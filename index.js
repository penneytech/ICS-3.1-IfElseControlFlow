/*
You are making an app that will tell someone if the package they're mailing is too heavy or not.

1) Declare a variable for the package weight. 
2) Create an if / else statement that will log:
    a) "The package is within weight limits!" if the package is under 15 lbs.
    b) "The package is overweight" in cases where it is not under 15 lbs. 
3) Set the initial value of the package weight to trigger the message in step 2.
